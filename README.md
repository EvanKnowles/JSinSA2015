# JSinSA2015
Slides and demo material from JSinSA 2015 on JavaScript security.

Demo material is mostly an (intentionally ;) XSS-vulnerable / CSRF-vulnerable pseudo webserver (in the spirit of MySpace I made it as hacky as possible - at least, that's my story)

Keynote slides are mostly picturesque (bonus points for identifying all the references), with fairly detailed presenter notes.
